# Flavor-Table:
 In this lab I tried to connect the backend with frontend by doing the fetch from the api and route it correctly from the backend.

 - how many days did it takes to complete it ?
   
   3 days

- Where there any parts that of the lab you found challenging ?
  Because it's my fisrt time, I found it a little but hard, there is a new ideas and I faced many errors during the process but in the same time
  I learned how I can troublshoot the issues from the inspect and from the backend side also how to built the routing with axios and make it speratly
